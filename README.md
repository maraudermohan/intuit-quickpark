* Developed this parking app in 24 hours, as part of Hackathon, Sep 28th 2016.
* Built using React + Redux, JQuery and Bootstrap.
* Connected to MongoDB using Mongoose.
* Main purpose is to maintain and update a database of available parking spots.
* The real-time data is user-submitted, similar to Waze 
  (for e.g. user submits the data when they park in or take the car out from a spot)
* Using GoogleMapsAPI, All available parking spots are indicated as markers in the google map.
* Also handles the use cases of Accessible parking. 
* App can be also easily extended to handle Carpool parking and Visitor parking use cases too.
* The database will be owned and monitored by WorkPlace services. 
* Successfully demo'd in front of the Hackathon judges.
* This was built on using [Pluralsight Starter kit](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house).
